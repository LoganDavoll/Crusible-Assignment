				<h2>Backstory</h2>
				<p>After the succession of many years on top of the market the
				very famous company, Botco., was losing its creative spark, along
				with its popularity. Engineers of the facility put their heads
				together and made a machine that didn't need creativity, they
				called it A-001. It would use modern media to see what was popular
				and make a new product based off of what the people wanted.
				However, such a high tech machine was never created before and with
				its first 20 tests, was deemed a failure, all of which almost
				instantly resulted in a blackout of the entire factory, causing it
				to lose power for 3 days with each test. A bit of time past and an
				employee had found something in the woods that was emitting incredible
				power, a small, half yellow, half gray stone that seemed to be slightly
				glowing. They made a new model, A-002, equipped with a spot to insert
				the power source. The first test didn't result in a blackout, but
				instead resulted in hostile robots that either killed or scared
				away all of the facility's workers. After all survivors had vacated
				the establishment, the factory got up, WALKED away, and was never
				seen again.</p>
				<br />
				<p>You, as the player, are set on finding all 9 of the Fragments of
				myth, made from the celestials themselves. The Celestials created a
				diamond long ago, infused with each of their powers to manipulate and
				store elements as energy. However, their creation ultimately led to their
				demise. They had to destroy it when one of them was consumed by greed, but
				the diamond was protected by a spell that caused a blast with the power
				of the force to harm it times 10. It shattered into fragments, releasing
				all of the energy stored inside it. This energy created to planet that
				the plyer lives on. The fragments were caught by the gravitational pull
				of the planet and fell down to the surface. Luck would have it that
				2 of the fragments did not separate and are being used as a power source
				for a big robot. Who knew?
